Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Treemo project! We look forward to seeing what you have to offer.

While we're greatly appreciative of your effort, to make sure that the inclusion of your patch is a smooth process, we
ask that you make note of the following guidelines.

* **Keep your code clean and readable.**

We can't stress this enough; if your code has notable issues, it may delay the process significantly. Comments explaining sections of code are also greatly appreciated.

* **Make sure your code is efficient.** 

One way you can achieve this is to spend around five minutes to think about what the code is doing and whether it
seems awfully roundabout. If you had to copy the same large piece of
code in several places, that may not be ideal.

* **Keep commit summaries under 70 characters.**

For more details, place two new lines after the summary line and write away!

* **Test your code.** 

We're not interested in broken code, for the obvious reasons.

* **Make sure everything is right before you send a pull request.** 

This helps us keep the process fairly fast and helps filter out issues. 

Checklist
---------

Ready to submit? Perform the checklist below:

1. Have you checked over your code to see if it complies with what's written above?
2. Have you combined your commits into a reasonably small number (if not one)
   commit?
3. Have you made pull request too large? Pull requests should introduce
   small sets of changes at a time. Major changes should be broken down into smaller commits, so it's easier to track if an issue occurs.
4. Are your commit messages descriptive?
